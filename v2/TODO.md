- could do away with content wrapper if we have no rows in the cell? though not very predictable?
	- can add dedicated styling for the content wrapper just in case?
	- this can focus on positioning within the cell

- for filtering, we can probably do "tagging" as a renderer?
	- need to intercept all the @input (and @label! events)
	- can auto tag
	- can offer customization options?
